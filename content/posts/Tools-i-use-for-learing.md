Welcome to the list of tools and resources that have helped me throughout my web development learning.

  

So let’s begin the list.

  

## [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/)

>Well-organized and easy-to-understand Web building tutorials with lots of examples of how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, PHP, Bootstrap, Java, XML, and more.

A web developer definitely knows this website. If you search any HTML, CSS, and JavaScript terms on Google, W3School’s web page will be among the top list. It’s a great website to learn web development in a sequence. It can also serve as learning different web development terms.

Tons of guides and tutorials on CSS. They have covered most of the topics in CSS and keep on adding more posts to cover topics beyond CSS. Their guide is awesome with code.
