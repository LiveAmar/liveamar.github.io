Welcome to the list of tools and resources that have helped me throughout my web development learning. 

So let’s begin the list.

## [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/)

![W3School.com](https://surajondev.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fc6f065d5-bdf7-4907-9939-cd0a9e8793b8%2Fwww.w3schools.com_.png?id=3355559c-528d-4060-b762-fe86c1541640&table=block&spaceId=2cdc7c4b-7dcc-4c1e-b871-85847b339283&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)

A web developer definitely knows this website. If you search any HTML, CSS, and JavaScript terms on Google, W3School’s web page will be among the top list. It’s a great website to learn web development in a sequence. It can also serve as learning different web development terms.
